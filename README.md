Papaer Name: Statistical Downscaled Climate Projection Dataset for China Using Artificial Neural Networks

GCMs: low resolution, have systematic biases (spatial and temporal)

Downscaling: Dynamical Downscaling, Statistical Downscaling(Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Network, ...)

Scientific question: How to combine the two types of data to obtain more accurate climate change forecasts for the future?
